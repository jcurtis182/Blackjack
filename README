Run by typing playBlackJack into the terminal, and exit at anytime with Ctrl+C. 

[!] There is a bug where if you input ` instead of a number for the menues, it will rapidly run through everything endlessly. It might do this for other keys as well, so just use the menu correctly.

I tested adding a split function, with creating two separate piles and all that, but it drastically complicated the Dealer's actions, and I didn't have time to mess with everything all over again. It should be possible though, so maybe later.
